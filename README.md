## Description
Our homework assignment was to create an application where the user can add, update, delete, and "devour" a burger that they input. The application was to run utilizing MySQL, node, express, handlebars, and a homemade ORM. My instructors have noted "to be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML."
